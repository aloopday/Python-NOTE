x ="Python is awesome"
print(x)
# In the `print()` function, you output 
# multiple variables, separated by a comma:

a ="apple"
b = " is "
c =" a fruit"
print(a,b,c)
print(a+b+c)# Notice the space character is very important
print (a,b,c)

# For numbers, the `+` character works as a mathematical operator:
o = 5
p = 10 
print( o + p)

## combine different type with the "commas"
print( o,a)
