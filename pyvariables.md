## Python Variables

## variables 
Var are containers for storing data values.

## Creating variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

## Casting 
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

## GET THE tYPE 
type() function to get the type of the data

## Python-Variable Name

## Variable Names

short name (like x and y ) or a more descriptive name (age,carname,total_volume)
.
## Rules for Python variables:
- must start with a letter or the underscore character
- cannot start with a number 
- can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores(A-Z,0-9,and _)
- case-sensitive(age,Age and AGE are three different variables)
- a variable name cannot be any of the "Python keywords"

## MultiWords -variable-names
## Camel Case
Each word, except the first ,starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName= "charles"
***Pascal Case***
Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "charles"
***Snake Case***
Each word is separated by an underscore character
```
my_variable_name ="charles"
```

## Python Variables - Assign 
Multiple Values

## Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

## One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the ***same*** value to multiple variables in one line:

## Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a `list`,`tuple` etc
Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

## Python -Output Variables

## Output Variables

`print()` function is often used to output variables.
