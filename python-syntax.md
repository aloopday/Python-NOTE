[Execute Python SyntaX](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp)

## TWO WAYS 
writing directly in  the Command line:
```
>>> print("Hello,World!")
Hello,World!
```
or by Creating a python file on the server,using the .py file extension, and running it tin the Command Line:
```
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
```
## Python Indentation
Indetation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other proramming languwages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indecate a block of code.

***The number of **** spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use if **four**, but it has to be at least one.

You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwide Python will gie you an error:
***syntax Error***
```
if 5>2:
    print("five is greater than 2")
        print("5 is greater than 2")
```
## python Variables
In python, vaiables are created when you assign a value to it:

## python has no command for declaring a variable.
## Comments
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
Comments start with a `#`,and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

## Python Statements

## statements
A **computer program** is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called **statements**

## Many Statements
Most Python programs contain many statements.
The statements are executed one by one, in the same oreder as they are written:
```
print("Hello World!")
print("Have a good day.")
print("Learning Python is fun!")
