[Slicing String](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp)

## Slicing 
You can return a range of characters by using  the slice syntax.

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon,
to return a part of the string.

## Slice From the Start 
By leaving out the start index , the range will start at the first character.
